## 📌 Why I Built This

This project was born out of a deep desire to sink my teeth into something completely new (and, let’s be honest — a little intimidating at first).  
I had never used React or Cloudflare before, so I challenged myself to build something from scratch that felt meaningful, practical, and even a bit fun.

Since I’m working towards a career in cloud computing, I wanted to start using cloud-based tools like Firebase in a hands-on way. This project gave me structure, helped me stay consistent with my learning, and doubled as a cool way to track my growth without relying on sticky notes and pure chaos.

I also used AI as a learning companion throughout this build. As someone who’s *extremely* curious by nature, having something I could bounce ideas off of, ask “what does this even mean?” twenty times a day, and experiment with was a game-changer.  
It honestly sparked so many moments of excitement — and made the whole learning process feel way more like play than pressure.

More than anything, this project feels like a milestone. It reminded me that growth doesn’t have to be serious all the time — sometimes it looks like colourful bubbles, lightbulb moments, and laughing at my own code errors before fixing them. I’m proud of what I’ve created, not because it’s perfect, but because it’s *mine* — and because it reflects the real me, learning out loud.

> Note: This app does **not** include authentication, as it’s a showcase project. In a production setting, features like login and account-based tracking would be essential.
