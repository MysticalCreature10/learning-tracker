## 📌 Why I Built This

This project was born out of a deep desire to sink my teeth into something completely new (and, let’s be honest — a little intimidating at first).  
I had never used React or Firebase before, so I challenged myself to build something from scratch that felt meaningful, practical, and even a bit fun.

Since I’m working towards a career in cloud computing, I wanted to start using cloud-based tools like Firebase in a hands-on way. This project gave me structure, helped me stay consistent with my learning, and doubled as a cool way to track my growth without relying on sticky notes and pure chaos.

I also used AI as a learning companion throughout this build. As someone who’s *extremely* curious by nature, having something I could bounce ideas off of, ask “what does this even mean?” twenty times a day, and experiment with was a game-changer.  
It honestly sparked so many moments of excitement — and made the whole learning process feel way more like play than pressure.

More than anything, this project feels like a milestone. It reminded me that growth doesn’t have to be serious all the time — sometimes it looks like colourful bubbles, lightbulb moments, and laughing at my own code errors before fixing them. I’m proud of what I’ve created, not because it’s perfect, but because it’s *mine* — and because it reflects the real me, learning out loud.

> Note: This app does **not** include authentication, as it’s a showcase project. In a production setting, features like login and account-based tracking would be essential.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core language used throughout the project  
- **React** – Component-based frontend library for building the UI  
- **Firebase (Firestore)** – Real-time cloud database for storing entries  
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment powering the development setup  
- **HTML5 + CSS3** – For layout, styling, and visual effects  
- **Git + GitHub** – Version control and code hosting  
- **VS Code** – Code editor used for development

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **Built functional components using React**  
  → I broke the app into small reusable building blocks (like the form and the list) using React.

- **Managed state and reactivity with React Hooks**  
  → I used special tools in React (called Hooks) to let the app remember and respond to user input.

- **Integrated a NoSQL cloud database (Firestore)**  
  → I connected the app to Firebase so learning entries are saved in the cloud and updated in real-time.

- **Created a responsive UI using modern HTML5/CSS3**  
  → I used modern HTML and CSS to make the app look good and work well on different screen sizes.

- **Designed a clean and themed interface with soft-glass effects**  
  → I designed the app to have a light, bubbly, and soft glass-like look for a modern user experience.

- **Used Git & GitHub for version control**  
  → I tracked changes to my code and uploaded my project online so others (like employers) can view it.

- **Worked with Node.js in the development workflow**  
  → I used Node.js behind the scenes to install tools, run the app locally, and manage packages like Firebase.
